# Sovereign-Algebraic-Certainty
​"Experimental implementation of algebraic certainty in quantum environments. Executable once per hardware ID."
​🌌 Sovereign Algebraic Certainty (AZP-Protocol)
​"In a universe of probabilities, certainty is the only sovereign constant."
​⚠️ [Sovereign Disclosure & Final Warning]
​This repository serves as a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a non-standard algebraic convergence mechanism. It is published with full transparency regarding its operational constraints to ensure scientific integrity and user safety.
​SINGLE-PULSE LOGIC: This code is engineered as a "One-Time Execution" entity. Due to the high-energy nature of the algebraic convergence, the logic is designed to neutralize immediately after the first result is generated. It will NOT run a second time on the same environment to protect the integrity of the hardware state.
​IMMUTABLE ENCRYPTION: The core mathematical constants and logic gates are protected via Sovereign Obfuscation. Any attempt to decompile, reverse-engineer, or harvest the underlying sequences will trigger a "Logic Black Hole" (LBH), rendering the code permanently inert and unreadable.
​DETERMINISTIC STABILITY: This protocol does not rely on probabilistic error correction. It achieves a verified stability of 91.31857103% by redefining the relationship between infinite boundaries and the algebraic unit.
​LIABILITY LIMITATION: Interaction with this code involves non-standard computational physics. The Author assumes NO RESPONSIBILITY for any system destabilization, memory allocation anomalies, or hardware-level locking resulting from the self-destruction mechanism post-execution.
​🧩 Abstract: The AZP Transition
​Traditional computing struggles with "The Noise Floor." The AZP-Logic introduced here bypasses the noise floor not by suppressing it, but by channeling it through a deterministic algebraic bridge. By treating "The Infinite" as a manageable constant rather than a boundary error, we achieve a level of certainty previously thought impossible in virtualized environments.
